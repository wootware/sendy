# What is Sendy?
Sendy is a self-hosted email newsletter application that lets you send trackable emails via [Amazon Simple Email Service (SES)](http://aws.amazon.com/ses/). This makes it possible for you to send authenticated bulk emails at an insanely low price without sacrificing deliverability.

For more information and related downloads for Sendy Server and other products, please visit [Send.co](https://sendy.co/?ref=Hcurv).

# How to use this image
Starting a Sendy instance is simple. 

```console
$ docker run -d \
  --name sendy \
  -e SENDY_FQDN=campaigns.example.com \
  -e MYSQL_HOST=db_sendy \
  -e MYSQL_PASSWORD=db_password \
  bubbajames/sendy:tag
```
... where `sendy` is the name you want to assign to your container, `campaigns.example.com` is your FQDN of Sendy server, `db_sendy` is your database server instance, `db_password` is the database user's password and `tag` is the tag specifying the Sendy version you want. See the list of tags above.

## Environment Varaibles 
### `SENDY_PROTOCOL` (Optional)  
HTTP protocol used in Sendy APP_PATH (`http` or `https`). Default: `http` 
### `SENDY_FQDN` (required)
The fully qualified domain name of your Sendy installation.  This must match the FQDN associated with your license.  You can [purchase a license here](https://sendy.co/?ref=Hcurv).   
### `MYSQL_HOST` (required) 
The MySQL server hosting your Sendy database.  
### `MYSQL_DATABASE` (optional)
The Sendy database name. Default: `sendy`.    
### `MYSQL_USER` (optional) 
Database user.  Default: `sendy`.   
### `MYSQL_PASSWORD` (required)
Database user's password. Not recommended for sensitive data! (see: Docker Secrets)
### `SENDY_DB_PORT` (optional)
Database port. Default: `3306`. 

## Docker Secrets
As an alternative to passing sensitive information via environment variables, `_FILE` may be appended to the previously listed environment variables, causing the initialization script to load the values for those variables from files present in the container. In particular, this can be used to load passwords from Docker secrets stored in /run/secrets/\<secret_name> files. (See [repository](https://github.com/bubbajames-docker/sendy) for sample secrets)

For example:

```console
$ docker run -d --name sendy -e MYSQL_PASSWORD_FILE=/run/secrets/mysql-root -d sendy
```

## Using `Dockerfile`
Pretty minimalistic `Dockerfile` as everything you need is already bundled.  Just provide environment variables or environment file.

```dockerfile
FROM bubbajames/sendy:5.2

# ... additional apache/php configurations here ... 
# e.g. copy your SSL Certificate and apache configurations if not using a load balancer.  
```
### Start a Sendy instance
The following starts an instance specifying an environment file.

```console
$ docker run -d -name sendy --env_file sendy.env -p 80:80 sendy
```

### Sample environment file
```ini
SENDY_FQDN=campaigns.example.com
MYSQL_HOST=db_sendy
MYSQL_DATABASE=sendy
MYSQL_USER=sendy
MYSQL_PASSWORD_FILE=/run/secrets/db_password
# MYSQL_PASSWORD=db_password
```

## Using `docker-compose`
Starts an HAProxy load balancer instance for SSL termination, a Sendy instance and a MySQL database instance with mounted volume for persisted data between restarts.  Also uses Docker Secrets to avoid exposing sensitive data via 'inspect'.

The latest `docker-compose.yml` and sample files are available from the image [repository](https://github.com/bubbajames-docker/sendy).  It is highly advised to clone this repository to ensure the latest samples are used.

```yaml
version: "3.7"

# Volumes for persisted data.

# Crontab Support
Crontab is installed and configured with the following jobs.

## Scheduled Campaigns
Schedule your marketing campaigns to send at specific times in the future.  This job executes every 5 minutes to determine if any campaigns should be started.

## Autoresponders
Set up autoresponders to incoming emails.  This job executes every 1 minute to determine if any emails require an autoresponse.

## Import Lists
Import list of contacts in CSV files.  This job executes every 1 minute to determine if any Import List jobs have been created and initiate CSV file import if needed.
